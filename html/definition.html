    <h3>Urban Dictionary Defintion</h3>
    
    <p>
A mythical species of horse that is extremely hard,if not impossible to catch. Only virgins can come near a unicorn.A unicorn's horn is known to neutralize poison, cure any disease, resurrect the dead, and the unicorn itself will choose its companion. If you ever meet a unicorn, if it is not looking at you, or coming near you, forget about being its companion, or even coming near it. If you manage to capture the unicorn, you will obtain immortality. Don't cage in a unicorn when you keep it. It will run away.
